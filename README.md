##Molecular Biophysics of DNA Recognition
Transcription is the process by which genetic information 
encoded in the DNA is copied as messenger RNA (mRNA). Proteins 
that are eventually synthesized by the ribosome require this 
mRNA as templates. The intricate business of executing and 
regulating transcription is carried out by a large suite of 
DNA-binding proteins. Our group is interested in the principles
that govern the interactions between transcription factors, a 
major functional class of DNA-binding proteins that direct 
transcriptional initiation, and DNA. Our studies are focused 
on the role of conformational dynamics and molecular hydration 
on DNA recognition and self-regulation by the transcription 
factors. A major thrust of our effects is aimed at understanding
how these interactions occur in the cellular environment, 
which is crowded with biological polymers and metabolites. 
Such an environment has the tendency of realizing weak
interactions and being highly sensitive to the behavior of 
water molecules. Our studies are aimed at understanding the 
physicochemical bases of these actions and establishing their 
biological effects in live cells.


##Transcription Factor Pharmacology
Molecular definition of DNA binding by transcription factors 
also helps reveal novel routes to targeting specific members 
within transcription factor families, for which strong
structural homology has frustrated their translational 
potential as drug targets. A strategic extension of our
interest in transcription factor biophysics is the development
of chemical control of specific transcription factors in vivo.
Factor-specific reagents represent much-needed additions to the
chemical biology toolbox with respect to targeted 
transcriptional control and have strong potential to impact 
multiple areas of bioengineering and therapeutics. A particular
target of interest is PU.1, a member of the ETS family and a 
key regulator of hematopoiesis. PU.1-specific compounds are 
attractive drug discovery leads in a growing list of diseases 
characterized by de-regulated PU.1 activity. We are currently
engaged in collaborative preclinical studies to evaluate the 
effect of targeting PU.1 in model systems such as acute myeloid
leukemia. In addition to pharmacology, we also work 
collaboratively on the medicinal chemistry of DNA-targeting 
drugs, with a particular interest in how the physicochemical
properties of these compounds impact their cellular uptake and 
trafficking in cells.
